# Ubuntu Apt Notice: i386 Architecture Warning

**Date:** 2025-09-15  
**System:** Asus Q500A (Ubuntu Jammy)  

---

## The Notice

```
N: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'https://repo.jellyfin.org/ubuntu jammy InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'
```

---

## What It Means

- **N:** This is a *Notice*, not an error.
- **binary-i386:** Refers to **32-bit Intel (i386)** packages.
- **doesn't support architecture 'i386':** The Jellyfin repository only provides **64-bit packages**.  
- Your package manager is still checking for i386 packages but finds none, so it skips them.

---

## Why It Happens

- Ubuntu enables multiarch (support for multiple architectures) by default.  
- Some systems keep i386 enabled for compatibility with Steam, Wine, or legacy 32-bit software.  
- Jellyfin only builds for 64-bit, so the repo simply doesn’t provide i386 packages.

---

## Impact

- ✅ This warning is harmless. Jellyfin installs and updates fine.  
- ❌ It does *not* mean something is broken.  
- You’ll just keep seeing this line during `apt update`.

---

## Options

### 1. Ignore It (Recommended)
- Safe and easiest option.  
- Nothing breaks, and Jellyfin works normally.

### 2. Remove i386 (Advanced)
- Check enabled architectures:
  ```bash
  dpkg --print-foreign-architectures
  ```
- If `i386` is listed and you don’t need 32-bit software, remove it:
  ```bash
  sudo dpkg --remove-architecture i386
  sudo apt update
  ```
- ⚠️ Warning: Only do this if you **don’t use Steam, Wine, or 32-bit apps**.

### 3. Purge All i386 Packages (Risky)
- List installed i386 packages:
  ```bash
  dpkg --list | grep i386
  ```
- Remove them:
  ```bash
  sudo apt purge '.*:i386'
  ```
- Then remove the architecture as in step 2.
