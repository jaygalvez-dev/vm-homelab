# 🛡️ VM Homelab – Personal Cybersecurity Lab

This repository documents my journey into Linux, virtualization, and cybersecurity.  
I’m building a **virtualized homelab** using Linux Mint as my daily driver and Kali Linux inside VirtualBox for hands-on practice.  

---

## ⚡ Highlights
- Installed and configured **Kali Linux VM** with VirtualBox  
- Practiced **Linux fundamentals** (filesystem navigation, permissions, process control)  
- Installed and tested security tools:  
  - `nmap`  
  - `hydra`  
  - `john`  
  - `metasploit-framework`  
- Configured VirtualBox Guest Additions for smoother performance  
- Created **VM snapshots** for safe rollbacks during experiments  
- Documented commands, configurations, and troubleshooting for reproducibility
