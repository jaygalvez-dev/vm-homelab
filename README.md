# 🛡️ VM Homelab – Personal Cybersecurity Lab

This repository documents my self-taught journey into Linux, virtualization, and cybersecurity.  
I’m building a **virtualized homelab** using Linux Mint as my daily driver and Kali Linux inside VirtualBox for hands-on practice with tools and workflows commonly used in cybersecurity.

---

## ⚡ Features
- **Virtualization:** VirtualBox setup with prebuilt Kali Linux VM
- **Linux Fundamentals:** Filesystem navigation, permissions, process management
- **System Administration:** Resource allocation (RAM, CPU, disk), Guest Additions, snapshot management
- **Networking:** NAT/bridged networking experiments and safe test scans
- **Security Tools:** Installed and tested tools such as:
  - `nmap`
  - `hydra`
  - `john`
  - `metasploit-framework`
- **Documentation:** Structured notes and troubleshooting logs for repeatable setups
